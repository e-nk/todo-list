# Todo List Manager

A simple command-line Todo List application built using Haskell. This application allows users to manage tasks, including adding, viewing, editing, marking as complete, and deleting tasks. The tasks are saved in a file for persistent storage.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks with a description, priority (High, Medium, Low), and due date.
- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks or filter to see only incomplete tasks.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify the description of existing tasks.
- **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved to a file (`tasks.txt`), allowing them to persist between sessions.
- **Help Menu**: Easily access available commands and usage instructions.
